That is the context for Wildflower, and Wildflower is the name of the company which Billie's friend ran. The lyrics contain two perspectives, one being Billie Eilish, and the other being the friend's-ex-turned-boyfriend. I split the solo into two parts based off that.\nPerformance wise, really try to bring out the dynamic contrast, and don't afraid to really sing loudly on the peaks of the phrase."

In general for the soloists, the written rhythms don't have to be exactly followed; rubato is encouraged. Lines between notes (eg m. 14, m. 19 - 4th beat) are glissandos. Like a sigh."
